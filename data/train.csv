 a href In memory of our friends HEATH LEDGER amp CONWAY WICKLIFFE perfect timing,0
" quot Listening to Hans Zimmer s The Dark Knight OST A Dark Knight feels like a surge of unstoppable motivation coursing through my veins, just like the determination of Batman himself. The powerful crescendos and intense rhythms awaken the inner hero within me, propelling me to conquer any challenge in my path. This track embodies the essence of strength, resilience, and unwavering resolve, just like the Caped Crusader. Let s channel our inner Batman and tackle the obstacles ahead with unwavering determination! quot I m Batman...",0
I think this movie is very entertaining,0
"The concept was great the execution was abysmal. These guys put Nolal on a pedestal. This movie had absolutely no world building outside of exposition. The movie goes like quot We got to go to India, we re in India, we got to go to Britain, we are in the UK. quot and repeat. The main character being almost emotionless is fine but when every character is equally as dull it creates a movie without stakes despite the world ending threat.",0
Really awesome Movie.. First time I watched it in 2020 it was like watching avatar for the first time... A Real Sleeper if you never saw it. This is one of those movies you EXPERIENCE not just watch... it wasn t even the acting.. it as the story in its entirety.. Loved It 5 Stars!!!!!,0
It has better story and effects than the Matrix and will go down as one of the most under appreciated pieces of cinema of the teens and 20s.,0
The best Batman ever billions time better than Ben Affleck,0
Tom Cruise is fantastic!! Whoever picked the cast really knew what they were doing. I was hooked from the beginning.,0
"If you watch this movie while inverted, the inverted scenes appear normal, and the normal scenes appear inverted.",0
Emily Blunt should have played the role for Captain Marvel,0
Bro if he started the day over at the end that means he s got the power again since he killed one and got covered in it s blood. He s basically Kenny from South Park now,0
So he s now a immortal world savior and he gets the girl in the end!,0
This movie is a total mind f amp #... I loved it. lt 3,0
I like this movie. I don t like other movies.,0
"Even though I know the 2nd law of THERMODYNAMICS ENTROPHY i.e. EXPANSION of GAS debunks outer space and even though I know why they don t know what GRAVITY is ITSELF in ANY FUNDAMENTAL WAY because it is FAKE INTANGIBLE,,,,I will always admire this movie for being totally awesome!!

Most beautifully shot piece of shit in history!!!,0
"Stories not actually that complicated. Wrapping your head around the technical side of things is challenging sure, but you dont need to understand them to understand what happened in thr movie. Its just like any other time travel movie when you get down to it.",0

Hans zimmer is a great artist the music is fantastic a masterpiece alone at night,0

HBO Max Friday Night Thriller I have enjoyed Mr T C work since Risky Business. Ground Hog Day meet The Matrix 3 risky business indeed Why T C is known for originality this was well risky but well played for younger male audiences. ,0
"Actor Network Theory, thank me later...",0
Hans Zimmer... the modern day movie score goat ,0
"This is probably my favorite film starring Tom Cruise......amazing story, great cast and talents, very good action. br br nd he s starred in many great films.",0
The best line in the movie is when the lady from the beginning that was explaining to him and she literally stopped and looked dead into his eyes and sail just try not to understand lol and that is tenet the movie all wrap in one lol,0
The Protagonist aka Black James Bond,0
Who s here for this masterpiece on February 2024,0

"Chills. Just utter chills, as the unplanned Batman Trilogy watch party begins on a Tuesday at 6.42 PM.",0
"Finally, a good science fiction film. br Strangely every once in awhile the planets aline into something that allows Hollywood writers, directors, producers, actors, and the endless armies of lighting, camera, costume, hair, make up, animal handlers, editors, sound experts, union officials, police, lawyers... oops, make that many hundreds of quot movie lawyers quot ...I think they help, right? Okay, I m not 100 sure enough about the movie lawyers helping instead of making things more complicated. Certainly, I d say just about any movie could do without HALF of the quot Executive Producers quot but the others involved are absolutely the... oops... HMMM. br Let me see. How to explain this... It s all about perspective. And, maybe quot faith quot . br You need to create something that, logically, just cannot be created. br br The making of a GOOD film is an unseemly task, fractured with hundreds of daily dilemmas that almost all never get fixed correctly, so a hundred work round fixes are made to temporarily fix the quot problem quot that only a few folks know about amp remember, and even fewer folks know the temporary work around fix. br So, you can see how these often little problems that were not meant to slow or even stop production DO stop shooting. br br This makes re shoots at strange late early hours in that twilight ZONE of quot is it real late or real early? quot half light br br Okay, the quot CREW quot gets put together so a movie can get put together. br .",0
its not memorable like danny elfmans though. its beautiful but its not synonymous with batman.,0
If Starship Troopers and Ground Hogs Day had a baby...,0
"If you rewind parts of this movie, your only fast forwarding it.",0
This movie is the CURE to insomnia. Can t sleep? Put this on you ll be asleep in minutes.,0
Nolan dropped too much acid for this movie ,0
heard they have a sequel in the works? im down for it.,0
I am 27 now and remember seeing this as a boy in cinemas. This track really makes me realise how much the world has changed since 2008.,0

This movie is a beautiful poem that means a lot to me.,0
I meditate to this.Strong feelings,0
Thumbs up to anyone who believes that the Batman Chase scene from the Stock Exchange in The Dark Knight Rises is one of the most iconic scenes ever created.,0
How is I never get tired of seeing Tom Cruise. Simply a force my himself ! What a wonderful movie!,0
This is the perfect movie to translate to a videogame. Why hasn t anyone done it yet??,0

"This is how I learned about Emily Blunt, and I fully endorse her to play Samus Aran if a Metroid film ever happens. br I love how the beginning of the film establishes everyone being extremely complacent on training their soldiers because Rita dominated after supposedly minimal training, when they have no idea that it took her probably a decade within a time loop.",0
what a touching ending. Excellent.,0
"Always makes me go cold, brilliant soundtrack",0
"1 February, 2024. First time hearing it. br br I love you",0
James Harden was so good in this.,0
Dude this Groundhog s day sequel is bad ass,0
Watched it 9 times. Can t get enough.,0
"I really like how they portrayed the new jackets here and how cage and Rita evolve as fighters. br br 99.8 of the UDF is on autopilot because most don t know how to use the suits to their full capacity incorrect use would just tear someone apart. But because cage and Rita were both able to train with no fear of death they pushed their bodies and minds in a way not possible normally, they both died so many times it probably was entire years of their life they lived through while training. br br And in the end you have two supersoldiers with more combined combat experience against the mimic horde than the ENTIRE UDF combined. br br I saw some people trashing this movie because cage falling in love with Rita felt out of place. br Tell me if you had to build a bond with someone and then watch them die over and over again for possibly years. How could you not grow attached or protective in some way?",0
Congratulations if you liked this. All I saw was a silly mess.,0
It s giving transformers vibes as well does anyone hear it?,0
How is JDW not a huge star??? He s amazing.,0
this movie is so underrated its insane,0
The movie so good they named it twice.,0
Such an amazing experience. I cant remember the last time a movie gave me such an adrenaline rush!,0
I remember in 2007 wondering whether Heath Ledger could match Jack Nicholson s portrayal of the Joker. The first glimpse showed that he would be even better,0
To bad the second one probably won t happen,0
The greatest movie you never heard of or saw. Alot of people missed out on this movie. Its was awesome.,0
Movie was a little confusing more futuristic will have to watch again to understand it,0
One of my favorite movies because you get to watch Tom cruise die over and over again,0
"Just rewatched this and I really really dig this movie, it s the biggest mind fuck of Nolan s filmography so far but its so damn good.",0

"Should have used a set of comb picks. That standard rake would not cut it on those locks. I mean really, you d want to index and practice like crazy before hand. But that pick would just destroy the tumblers and you d be out of air.

You can then grind a pick profile by using the edge of a curb. Don t grind too fast or you ll wreck the temper of the spring steel. Dump water on it while you grind if it s handy.

"This is thing is so stupid an wayyy over price! I m a tech reviewer and I m telling you the quest 2, which is only 200 now. Does everything that does. and n more! N funner n lighter. And I m telling you it s a lot better to have a VR headset that has controllers. And if you just wants to use your hands like the Apple VR it does it as well but it s just better having controllers for the fun games that you can playhat way you can play games. And even as old as the quest 2 it even does the hands controlling as well but it s just a lot better to have controllers. But a lot of people think that the main reason for the The Apple VR is so cool and different is because it has no controllers which is completely wrong The quest to can do the same thing you could just use your hands if you want. But it sucks you want to have controllers because you can play games with fun games. I love watching movies laying down with are playing games",1

Thank you! I always come to your channel to help me decide whether or not I should finally upgrade.,1
"I know this is not a shared opinion, amongst tech geeks, but am I the only one, that thinks this is beyond pointless? Technology like the apple vision pro, is like automotive racing, for instance Porsche Motor Racing, came up with a car that broke multiple lap records, when they were told that the company was now quot restriction free quot and made the 919 Hybrid Evo. To me, this is what Apple has now done. Made an insane feat of technological engineering, but for what purpose. No right mind, no matter income or sustained wealth, would ever really buy the product unless forced to. I have been an admirer of Apple since the very first iPhone in 2008, But this has gone way beyond anything I ve ever imagined. To pay, what, 4000 USD for a pair of googles that show you VR content, like any other lower priced goggle...",1
I got the iPhone 15 in December and it s been amazing! Dynamic Island is great battery life is fantastic and usb c is good to have. And honestly it s smoother than my old phone and that was 90 hz,1
they re just tr urning into razer. not bad but ive had bad expiriences with them over heating,1
How well does the g16 fit into the average backpack? I don t hear any reviews mentioning this in detail.,1
What s the name of Dave s watch? The specifi model and color I mean,1
"Considering that the G16 uses liquid metal instead of conventional thermal paste, does the laptop have some kind of structure that prevents the liquid metal from going where it s not supposed to when it s time to replace the liquid metal?",1

"I just received the 2024 G14 with 4060. It plays everything I have thrown at it at highest levels without problems.

Who tf even cares at this point about the texture or colour of the glass back that ll be hidden the instant you case it up. Phone manufacturers are so darn out of touch with consumers I swear. Apple s stock price decline is 100 deserved.,1
People defending Apple that 120hz is not needed and apple has upgraded processor br Well A15 is fast enough for 99 users...A16 doesn t make any difference to Casual consumer but 60 hz does,1
Lets just break this product down. It s a joke. If you think you need this thing I got a bridge to sell you.,1
I just upgraded from 10XR to IPhone 15,1
Coming from a free government phone Vortex My iPhone 15 is simply amazing. The camera is just insane! I wish you were able to pause while recording video instead of just stopping. Other than that I m very happy with my purchase.,1
"Seems like the 16 quot 4070 build only comes with 16GB RAM, that s disappointing.",1
the fact that you didn t even once mentioned gaming saddens me. so much of this tech could be used to make amazing gaming experiences but Apple has always shunned gaming and viewed it as a second class citizen,1
they look good but the pricing seems to be very steep.,1
Finally at last a well made laptop with decent speakers. Great review thanks for covering the audio.,1
I think the 2023 white G14 looks way better than the silver 2024 model,1

These all rubbish iphones are hot as hell after light use,1

"Waiting for Valve to manage to make Vision Pro for the masses maybe less expensive, running Linux SteamOS , without having to buy into Apple s ecosystem. br br The Vision Pro, despite being a bit of a vanity product, looks absolutely incredible.

And drivers can enable it only when they are less than one second from the car in front and in specific DRS zones. You should correct that.",2
"welp, with those exterior corners and thinking about the EU ECE R26 regulation.... this vehicle will probably not be available in many countrys",2
These drivers have real skills.,2
I wonder how many spectators get injured in such events,2
"the most overengineered thing Ive ever seen! its cool as hell, but I would be terrified to buy one of these. Theres so many individual parts that can break, and I assume the parts and labor are ungodly expensive. Also I never like buying version 1.0 of anything, I let others do the beta testing first.",2
Didnt Tango n CasH have this truck already???,2

Not Watching since the Engine change. V8 for ever!!,2
I didn t really watch much rally before but started playing dirt rally 2.0. Good to know that they also slide and roll all over the place. Of course the tracks in the game are limited and I restart the same one over and over again. Also I still use the slower cars.,2
formula 1 is a pretty good phone. but too expensive for me,2
"Very interesting video, I might start watching F1 now! Sounds very interesting",2
"Good evening boss,what s the best TV to buy at the moment 65inches",2
The mkbhd car looks better than most,2
Its so ugly like why would you buy this????,2
"Waw, like no one knows what formula 1 is, go find something better to do, and maybe do something useful for the world for a change",2
Whenever you see a shell car you know your about to see something magical,2
It looks like an overpriced garbage truck. That truck is useless.,2
"100 hate software controls. Get why Tesla is doing this cheaper, amp totally taking the driver out of the picture with quot self driving quot , but there is NOTHING better than beautifully designed REAL buttons and knobs that control everything important amp easy to grab adjust when driving. Have a Tesla S and Y in the family and the UI is horrifyingly dangerous when actually driving...way too many things require taking your eyes OFF the road to navigate nested counter intuitive menus. My dad wrecked his Tesla S looking down and to the right while trying to adjust the defroster when the front windshield suddenly fogged up!!!! Not even going to mention how ridiculous not having the main screen in front of the steering wheel is. Audi s etron UI and ergonomics CRUSH Teslas...which is a crying shame b c the Tesla is a better all electric car.",2
Also not the guy who as all the titles is necessarily the best ever.,2
How to stop this SPONCERED nuisance?,2
You forgot about the pit stop championship,2
That Hyundai driver really whipping it,2
One of the worst videos of MKBHD felt like he was more of forced and promotion oriented video gt gt gt could easily feel it lacked interest and passion in it,2
