"How human like that most alien movies are them being the hostile ones, not us. There aren t many movies that portray aliens as friendly and harmless and I think history has proven they mean us no harm because if they did, there wouldn t be a human left on earth. Humans love violence, and cruelty and wars and destruction to anything alive that gets in their way. The aliens are lucky they need not fear the human being.",0

"Source Code meets Tomorrow War. And although both have been done, very riveting movie.",0
For all those wondering about a sequel. Emily Blunt was interviewed and she said the film cost way too much money. So the chances of them getting funded for a second is slim to none but she is also down if they did want to do a second.,0

His teeth being replaced.... as someone who s had a few implants.... Such an intense thing at the beginning of the movie that almost feels glossed over except for that full faced smile he gives Neil when they get in the ambulance. Supernatural teeth. He does not smile with his teeth at any other time in the movie and when he does in that moment it s absolutely radiant.,0
The Blu Ray has the IMAX ratio changes!,0
"Best movie in Nolan s career by FAR. The problem is most people don t get it so they criticize it. With every watch, the masterpiece gets better. Glad so many here feel the same.",0

The only reason stoping me from buying androids is that their pictures don t look good on social media. So if they optimized their apps for androids then what s stoping me from getting a phone with good camera and 120hz screen that i can cuztomize the way i want. And thats why people think iphones are better.,1
Just to show you what better Apple or Android look what phone hes using the end lol,1
"It has been a topic of discussion among tech enthusiasts regarding Apple s shift towards type C. However, it s worth acknowledging that the European Union played a crucial role in making this transition possible. Without the EU s efforts, this shift towards type C may not have been possible at all.",1
"I imagine this to be a really successfully mass product in the future IF they make it way smaller maybe like googles glass , cheaper, longer battery life and still visually as sharp or maybe even better but for now its just too big, too heavy, too expensive and 2 4 hrs battery life is just not enough...

"About the usb c charging, the efficiency of the usb c charging above a certain amount less than 240watts makes it be very inefficient. The new charger tip thingy lets more power to be pumped through. But you can charged through USB c",1

Note The G14 has one of its USB C port as a USB4 so it is compatible with Thunderbolt 3 stuff.,1
Why the 80 charging limiter doesn t exist in my 14 Pro Max ,1
Nice!. Now all I have to do is just wait till next year for the RTX 50 series.,1
"I think I found the laptop I m gonna get this year. The 2024 G14 is just right I like how minimalist and portable the design is given it s specs and number of IO. Just one thing, can any of its Type C ports support PD charging for the laptop? The power brick is chonky AF.",1

I wanted one and had one preordered but cancelled after performance reviews came out. As a gamer I still prefer performance over look and feel.

"But I don t get why they make those lines at the speakers... If it is so expensive to make it a unibody chassi, why make it look like they are seperate parts? Doesn t look good in my opinion. Would be better if it is like Blade or MacBook with holes right in the body and a clean surface",1
