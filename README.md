"When you're setting out to create your own dataset for text classification, aim for a comprehensive collection. You'll need at least 2000 words overall, and your dataset should include at least three distinct categories. For our text classification, we used three categories: sports, movies, and technology. Each of these categories should have a minimum of 1000 examples, which could be anything from a poem to a paragraph from a book. Additionally, I've utilized the YouTube v3 API to extract video comments, which can provide a rich source of real-time, user-generated content. For our project, we divided the dataset into training and test sets in an 80-20 split. You have several options for gathering data: you might consider web scraping, utilizing non-confidential documents you already have, or even generating text with tools like ChatGPT."
